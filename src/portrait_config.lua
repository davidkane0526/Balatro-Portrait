-- Steamodded appends its MODS button to the main menu panel and restyles that
-- panel on the way past, which left the button hanging beside the menu with the
-- rest of it knocked out of line (#44). Takes the finished definition, lifts the
-- button out and seats it next to Options and Quit at their size, and puts the
-- panel's own styling back. Runs only when that button is actually there, so a
-- build without Steamodded keeps the menu exactly as it was.
-- Steamodded's mod list is laid out for a desktop window: three boxes to a row,
-- a pane asking for a fixed 17 tiles of width and a list area with a fixed 5
-- tiles of height. On a phone the row ran off both edges with the last mod's
-- toggle out of reach, and the pane's frame sat off screen entirely (#45).
--
-- Three things are done to it, all measured rather than guessed, because a mod
-- box is as wide as its name, author and version make it:
--   * every box gets its own row, which is the narrowest the list can be laid
--     out and so the only arrangement that survives a long mod name,
--   * anything asking for more width than the room has is clamped to the room,
--     which brings the pane's frame back on screen,
--   * the list area is grown to whatever the rows actually measure once they
--     are built, since Steamodded attaches them as a child UIBox that does not
--     resize its host, so a page of them simply drew over the header and pager.
-- Pagination, ordering and the boxes themselves stay Steamodded's, so this
-- holds across its releases. Idempotent, and a no-op without it or in landscape.
-- Steamodded's mod list is laid out for a desktop window: twelve mods a page,
-- three to a row, a pane asking for a fixed 17 tiles of width and a list area
-- with a fixed 5 tiles of height. On a phone the rows ran off both edges with
-- the last mod's toggle out of reach, and the pane's frame sat off screen
-- entirely (#45).
--
-- Rather than squeeze twelve desktop-sized rows onto a phone, the page is made
-- smaller and the pager it already draws does the rest:
--   * one mod per row, which is the narrowest the list goes and so the only
--     arrangement a long mod name cannot break,
--   * a page holds mod_list_page_size of them instead of twelve, so the window
--     is a fixed, comfortable height with its back bar well clear of the home
--     indicator, whatever the mod count,
--   * the page selector is rebuilt for the new page count, so every mod is
--     still reachable, one page turn away,
--   * anything asking for more width than the room has is clamped to it, which
--     brings the pane's frame back on screen.
-- The boxes, their order and the page mechanism stay Steamodded's, so this
-- holds across its releases. Idempotent, and a no-op without it or in landscape.
